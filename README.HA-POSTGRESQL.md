# Jellyfin HA with PostgreSQL

This fork combines three pieces on a Jellyfin 10.11.11 base:

- the Redis-backed transcode coordination code from `ZoltyMat/jellyfin-ha`;
- the PostgreSQL query optimizations from `Nichols-HomeLab/jellyfin`;
- the PostgreSQL database provider from `Nichols-HomeLab/Jellyfin.Pgsql`, pinned as a Git submodule.

The PostgreSQL provider remains experimental. Back up the Jellyfin config and
database before migrating an existing server.

## Build

Clone the fork and initialize the provider submodule:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nichols-HomeLab/jellyfin-ha.git
cd jellyfin-ha
git submodule update --init plugins/Jellyfin.Pgsql
docker build -f Dockerfile.pgsql -t jellyfin-ha-pgsql:10.11.11 .
```

The image publishes the complete HA server and the PostgreSQL plugin together.
It deliberately does not overlay a single patched assembly on an official
Jellyfin image because the HA changes span several server assemblies.

## Required configuration

Configure both PostgreSQL and Redis:

```yaml
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin-ha-pgsql:10.11.11
    environment:
      POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING: >-
        Host=postgres;Port=5432;Database=jellyfin;Username=jellyfin;Password=change-me
      Jellyfin__TranscodeStore__RedisConnectionString: redis:6379,abortConnect=false
      Jellyfin__TranscodeStore__LeaseDurationSeconds: "30"
      Jellyfin__TranscodeStore__RecoveryRetentionSeconds: "300"
      Jellyfin__CatalogOwnership__ProbeIntervalSeconds: "2"
      JELLYFIN_INSTANCE_ID: jellyfin-1
    volumes:
      - jellyfin-config:/config
      - jellyfin-cache:/cache
      - jellyfin-transcode:/transcode
      - /path/to/media:/media:ro
```

`POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` takes precedence over the legacy
`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variables. `JELLYFIN_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` is also
accepted as an alias.

For multiple replicas, every instance needs:

- the same PostgreSQL database;
- the same Redis deployment;
- a unique `JELLYFIN_INSTANCE_ID` (a pod or task name is suitable);
- shared read-write `/config` and `/transcode` storage;
- the same read-only media paths on every node.

Use a load balancer with session affinity for normal playback traffic. Redis
leases coordinate recovery; they are not a replacement for stable request
routing while the owning instance is healthy.

PostgreSQL-backed replicas also elect exactly one catalog writer with a
session-level advisory lock. Only that replica runs scheduled tasks or dispatches
filesystem-monitor refreshes; every replica continues serving HTTP and playback.
The owner health-checks its lock session at the configured interval (between
0.05 and 30 seconds), releases it during graceful shutdown, and cancels running
scheduled work if PostgreSQL coordination is lost. Until coordination succeeds,
the server fails closed for catalog work. Ownership acquisition and loss are
logged with `JELLYFIN_INSTANCE_ID`. Normal SQLite deployments retain their
single-instance behavior and require no additional configuration.

## First start

Use an empty PostgreSQL database and an empty Jellyfin config directory for the
first validation start. The entrypoint installs the provider under
`/config/plugins/PostgreSQL`, creates `/config/config/database.xml` when it is
missing, and writes the configured connection string into that file before
starting Jellyfin.

The existing SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration procedure is documented in the
provider submodule's `README.md`. Do not point an untested build at the only
copy of an existing Jellyfin library.

## Validation

The server build and HA-focused tests can be run without installing the .NET
SDK on the host:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 \
  dotnet build Jellyfin.Server/Jellyfin.Server.csproj --configuration Release
```

Build the final image with `Dockerfile.pgsql` to validate that the pinned
provider and server source compile together.
